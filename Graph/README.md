## Graph 
Graphs consist of `nodes` and `edges`. Graphs can be used to represent any `networks`, relationships between items. 

Graph can be of many types 

`weighted` and `un-weighted` : each link has a cost associated with it. 

`directed` and `un-directed` : link is bidirectional or unidirectional.
