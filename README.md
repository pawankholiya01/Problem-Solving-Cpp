# Problem-Solving-C++
Its my dumping ground for various C++ codes I wrote for classical/competitive Programming Problems.


## Tips (Go to Approach) :

If given a Tree/Graph then
- DFS
- BFS


If input array is sorted then
- Binary search
- Two pointers

If asked/generate all permutations/subsets then  - Backtracking

If asked to generate any/all solutions 
- Backtracking

If very complex counting kind problem
- Backtracking

If feel like multiple nested for loops that are conditional on input
- backtracking

If given a linked list then
- Two pointers

If linklist backtraversing pointer needed then
- Recursion (Head Recursion)

If recursion is banned/TLE then
- Stack

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
- Dynamic programming

If asked for counting then
- Dynamic programming (Optimising Backtracking)

If most subproblems are needed/Tighter Constraints in DP then
- Tabulation in DP 

If Memoization/BruteForce Recursion fails then :
- Recursion + store solved sub-problems.

If asked for top/least K items then
- Heap

If asked for common strings then
- Map
- Trie

If O(1) operations needed then 
- map or unordered_map 

If O(logn) time operations needed then 
- set , multi_set

If find first/Number of elements greater than/equal to then 
- lower_bound, upper_bound (in sorted )
